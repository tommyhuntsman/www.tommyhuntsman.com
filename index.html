          <p>You know very well who you are, reach for the star. - Biggie Smalls</p>
          <p>You have got to find what you love. It's as true for your work as it is for your lovers. The only way to be truly satisfied
          is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet,
          keep looking. As with all matters of the heart, you know when you have found it. And like any great relationship, it just gets
          better with time. - Steve Jobs
